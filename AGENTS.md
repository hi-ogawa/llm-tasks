# Agent Conventions

Portable workflow conventions for any coding agent (Claude Code, opencode, Codex CLI, gemini-cli, etc.).

## Session Lifecycle

### Quick Questions (One-shot)

For lightweight questions that don't need a dedicated task:

1. Just answer in conversation (ephemeral)
2. If user wants to keep it: append to `notes/scratch.md` with date header
3. If it grows substantial: user can say "let's make this a task" → promote to full task

### Starting a New Task

When user says "new task [topic]", "explore [topic]", or similar:

1. Create `YYYY-MM-DD-[topic]/`
2. Create `README.md` with brief overview (what, why)
3. Create `plan.md` for detailed planning and progress
4. Create `notes/` directory
5. Begin working in that directory

### Resuming Work

When user says "continue [topic]" or references an existing task:

1. Find matching task directory at repo root
2. Read `README.md` and `plan.md` for context
3. Continue from where left off

### Finishing Up

When user says "done", "finish", "let's commit", or "save and push":

1. `git add -A`
2. `git commit -m "[descriptive message based on work done]"`
3. `git push`
4. Confirm completion to user

### Syncing

When user says "sync" or "pull latest":

1. `git pull --rebase --autostash`
2. Report any conflicts if they occur

## Directory Structure

```
YYYY-MM-DD-[topic]/
  README.md      # What and why (brief)
  plan.md        # Detailed planning, progress log
  notes/         # Research notes, references
  scripts/       # Any automation (with pyproject.toml if Python)
  data/          # Generated outputs (often gitignored)
```

## Meta Commands

Shorthand commands for common workflow actions. The `[command]` syntax works well with Claude Code; other agents may need natural language equivalents.

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `[q]` | Quick question - answer ephemerally, no files |
| `[new]` | Create new task directory, scaffold files, start working |
| `[continue]` | Find task, read context, resume |
| `[note]` | Append to `notes/scratch.md` with timestamp |
| `[promote]` | Convert scratch notes into dedicated task |
| `[done]` | Git add, commit (with message), push |
| `[sync]` | Git pull --rebase --autostash |

Examples:
```
[q] what's the difference between MCP and LSP?
[new] vim-keybindings
[note] check out this approach for modal editing
[save]
[done] added research on directory-backed chat
```

Natural language alternatives work too ("let's commit", "save this note", etc.).

## Research Tasks

For research/exploration tasks, structure files as follows:

### README.md

- Terse background context (your situation)
- Goal of the research
- List of files with one-line descriptions

### plan.md

- Checklist of questions to answer
- Action items (things to do IRL)
- Progress log with dates
- Quick reference for key concepts

### notes/

- Detailed research findings
- Tables for quick comparison
- Always include `## Sources` with links for verifiable info
- Side notes for tangential topics (e.g., `notes/side-topic.md`)

## Principles

- **Files are the source of truth** - conversation is ephemeral, outputs persist
- **User controls what to save** - agent writes what user instructs
- **Commands and natural language** - both work, user's choice
- **Sources matter** - include links for verifiable/fact-checked information

## Tooling

- **Python**: Use `uv` for dependency management. See [docs/scripting.md](docs/scripting.md).
