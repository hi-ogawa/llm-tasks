# CLI Binary Management on Arch Linux

Finding a maintained alternative to `gh-bin` for installing single-binary CLI tools.

## Background

I made `gh-bin` to one-shot install CLI binaries from GitHub releases to `~/.local/bin`. It's a thin hack that works surprisingly well, but I don't want to maintain it.

The pattern it solves: many dev CLI tools suggest `curl | bash` installation, dropping a binary into local/bin. I wanted something cleaner.

**gh-bin's pragmatic assumptions**:

- Always install to `~/.local/bin` - convenient but general-purpose tools need path flexibility
- Requires Node runtime - can't bootstrap itself on a fresh machine (this was the original motivation to find alternatives when setting up WSL)

**Prior experience**: Scoop on Windows native was a good experience (user-space CLI tools, no admin). Moving to WSL, Homebrew is the closest equivalent.

## Options

| Tool           | What it is                             | Tradeoff                                           |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **ubi**        | Direct GitHub/GitLab binary downloader | No install tracking, need `--in` flag              |
| **Homebrew**   | Full package manager                   | Heavier, but has upgrade tracking + huge ecosystem |
| **mise + ubi** | mise uses ubi as backend               | Adds tracking layer, `mise upgrade` works          |
| **aqua**       | Declarative CLI version manager        | Smaller registry than Homebrew                     |

## Decision

**Homebrew** - covers 90% of needs with trusted ecosystem. Minor itches acceptable.

For the remaining 10% (tools not in Homebrew): ubi or official installers.
