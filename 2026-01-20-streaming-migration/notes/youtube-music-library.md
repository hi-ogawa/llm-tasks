# YouTube Music Library & Artists Tab Research

## How Content Gets Into Artists Tab

**Actions that populate Artists tab:**

- "Save to library" (three dots → Save to library)
- Save an album → all songs + artist added

**What does NOT populate Artists tab:**

- Just adding to a playlist (playlists are separate from library)
- Liking videos (goes to Liked Music playlist, not Artists tab)

## Art Track vs Everything Else

The key distinction for Artists tab is **Art Track vs everything else** - not just "official vs unofficial."

| Type             | Description                                                            | "Add to library" available? |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Art Track**    | Auto-generated by YouTube, static cover art + audio, ISRC/UPC metadata | Yes ✓                       |
| **Music Video**  | Official video from same artist                                        | Only if linked to Art Track |
| **User uploads** | Covers, live performances, unofficial                                  | No                          |

**Art Tracks:**

- Official YouTube term for auto-generated videos from distributor uploads
- Shows "Auto-Generated by YouTube" tag in description
- Static cover art + audio (no video content)
- Identified by ISRC/UPC metadata
- Appears on "[Artist Name] - Topic" channels
- Created via TuneCore, DistroKid, labels, etc.

**Key insight:** Even official music videos from the same artist don't populate Artists tab - only the Art Track version does.

**Exception - Linked videos:** Some music videos are time-matched/linked to their Art Track. For these:

- YouTube Music shows Song/Video toggle
- "Add to library" is available (even for the video)
- Adding to library → Artists tab ✓

Over 5 million official music videos are linked this way.

## How to Identify Art Tracks

**Art Track indicators:**

- "Auto-Generated by YouTube" in description
- Static cover art (no actual video)
- On "[Artist Name] - Topic" channel
- Clean title format: "Song Name" (no "Official Video", "Lyrics", etc.)

**"Music in this video" section:**

- Appears on music videos/covers when Content ID matches
- Does NOT mean it's an Art Track
- These still won't populate Artists tab

## YouTube vs YouTube Music Actions

| Action          | Available on                    | Effect                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Like            | youtube.com + music.youtube.com | Liked Music playlist + affects recommendations          |
| Add to library  | music.youtube.com only          | Library (Artists tab) without affecting recommendations |
| Add to playlist | both                            | Playlist only (no library/Artists tab)                  |

**Key points:**

- "Add to library" does NOT exist on main youtube.com
- "Like" on youtube.com syncs to YT Music Liked playlist (requires setting: "Show your liked music from YouTube")
- "Like" does NOT populate Artists tab - only "Add to library" does
- "Add to library" is only available for Art Tracks (and linked music videos)

**Implication for workflow:** Activity can stay on youtube.com (playlist or like). For Artists tab, must visit music.youtube.com to "Add to library" for each song.

## Confusing: "Library" Tab vs "Library" (Artists Tab)

YouTube playlists show up under Library tab in YT Music, but their contents don't populate Artists tab.

```
Library tab shows:
├── Playlists ← YouTube playlists appear here
├── Songs ← only liked/saved songs
├── Albums
└── Artists ← only from liked/saved songs, NOT from playlist contents
```

**"Library" has two meanings:**

1. The Library **tab** (UI container) - shows playlists, songs, albums, artists
2. Your **library** (the collection) - only songs you've liked/saved, which populates Artists

Adding a song to a playlist ≠ adding to your library. Confusing but intentional design.

**No batch "library-fy" for playlists:** Multi-select exists on web (checkboxes), but only supports: add to playlist, play next, add to queue. No batch "Like" or "Add to library." Must like/save each song individually. Third-party scripts exist (e.g., youtube-music-playlist-liker on Greasyfork) but risk account issues.

## How YouTube Determines "Music" (for YT Music sync)

Not all liked YouTube videos appear in YT Music - only those classified as "music."

**Heuristics (not publicly documented):**

1. **Video category** - uploader sets to "Music" when uploading
2. **Content ID match** - audio matches registered song (even covers trigger this)
3. **ML classification** - YouTube analyzes audio/visual content
4. **Metadata signals** - title, description, tags with music keywords

**Why unofficial music videos appear:** Category set to "Music", Content ID match, or ML detected music.

**Why random videos don't appear:** Category is "Entertainment"/"Gaming"/etc., no music match.

**Setting:** "Show your liked music from YouTube" toggle controls whether YouTube-liked videos (classified as music) sync to YT Music.

## Albums

- Albums are created by artists through music distributors
- Users cannot "make" albums
- Can only save existing albums to library
- Saving an album adds all songs + artist to library

## Batch Operations

**Cannot batch:**

- No native way to select multiple songs and save to library at once
- No batch "Like" for multiple songs
- Songs must be added one-by-one
- No automated batch import from YouTube playlist to library

**Workaround:** Automation via `ytmusicapi` or browser automation

## Why Not Spotify?

**Tools exist** (Soundiiz, TuneMyMusic) to sync YouTube → Spotify, but:

- Only transfers songs that exist on Spotify
- Covers, live performances, unofficial content = won't transfer
- Results in split listening: Spotify (official) + YouTube (unofficial)
- Extra complexity for worse coverage

**Verdict:** YouTube + YT Music simpler for content mix with unofficial material.

## Desktop Free Tier (with ad-block)

Assuming ad-block works on music.youtube.com:

- On-demand playback ✓
- Background play ✓ (keep tab open)
- Main limitation: **128kbps audio** (vs 256kbps premium)

Mobile free tier is painful (no background play) - subscription mainly needed for mobile.

## Workflow Decision

**Verdict:** YouTube (like) + YouTube Music (listen) can replace VLC workflow.

**On YouTube (main activity):**

1. Like any music-related video
2. (Optional) Add to "todo" playlist if bass practice candidate

**On YT Music (async review, when needed):** 3. Review Liked playlist 4. For each song:

- Has "Add to library" option → do it → Artists tab
- No option → add to fallback playlist

**Why this works:**

- "Collect" action (like) stays on YouTube - no workflow change
- "Add to library" action happens async on YT Music (for Artists tab)
- Linked videos (with Song/Video toggle) can be added to library
- Unofficial content goes to fallback playlist

Still simpler than: download → transfer → VLC.
