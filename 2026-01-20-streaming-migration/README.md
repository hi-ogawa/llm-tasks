# Local Audio → Streaming Migration

Enabling mobile listening via YouTube Music while keeping YouTube as the primary activity hub.

## Background

**Current workflow:**

- Desktop: YouTube + ublock for discovery/listening
- "Todo" YouTube playlist: bass cover candidates (ephemeral - remove after covering)
- Custom desktop GUI app (yt-dlp-like) to download with proper metadata
- VLC downloads: permanent archive, superset of todo playlist
- Mobile: VLC for commuting, browsing curated collection by artist

**Pain point:** Manual download/transfer workflow for mobile listening

**YouTube Music state:** Only 8 songs in library (from rare likes + official song associations)

## Goal

Primary: VLC collection accessible on mobile via YouTube Music

Secondary:

- "Todo" playlist items sync to YT Music library
- Recover removed "todo" items by cross-referencing VLC downloads
- Handle unofficial content (live performances, etc.) gracefully

**Open to:** Changing YouTube habits (e.g., liking videos) if it replaces the local download workflow

## Constraints

**YouTube Music "Artists tab" limitation:**

- Only shows content with official music metadata (ISRCs) - "songs"
- Regular YouTube videos (covers, live performances, unofficial) don't appear
- See `notes/youtube-music-library.md` for details

**Implication:** Not all VLC content will get Artists tab organization. Unofficial content still accessible via Liked playlist or custom playlist - just no per-artist mobile browsing.

## Conclusion

**Yes, YouTube + YouTube Music can replace the VLC workflow.**

New workflow:

**On YouTube (main activity):**

1. Add to "Good music" playlist
2. (Optional) Also add to "todo" playlist if bass practice candidate

**On YT Music (async, when needed for mobile):** 3. Review "Good music" playlist 4. For songs with "Add to library" option → do it → Artists tab

**Why this works:**

- "Save" action stays on YouTube (playlist, not like)
- "Organize" action happens async on YT Music
- Keeps curated music separate from likes (which affect recommendations)
- Still simpler than: download → transfer → VLC

**Fallback playlist:** For non-library-able songs (OMV/UGC), use `scripts/export_non_library.py` to copy them to a separate playlist for mobile access.

## Results

Migration of 727 unique tracks from VLC collection:

| Category          | Count | %   |
| ----------------- | ----- | --- |
| Art Tracks (ATV)  | 458   | 63% |
| Non-ATV (OMV/UGC) | 269   | 37% |

**What this means:**

- 63% get full Artists tab experience (browse by artist on mobile)
- 37% are in fallback playlist only (no artist organization)
- Within non-ATV, some are unplayable on YT Music entirely (licensing issues)

**Why non-ATV is high:**

- Live performances, covers, unofficial content
- Indie/smaller labels without YT Music distribution deals
- Some Asian labels focused on home market streaming (not YT Music)

**Verdict:** ~60-70% good experience, not the 90-95% hoped for. Collection has a lot of non-mainstream content that doesn't fit YT Music's library model.
