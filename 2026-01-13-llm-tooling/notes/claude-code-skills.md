# Claude Code Skills

## Overview

Skills are **model-invoked capabilities** that Claude automatically discovers and uses based on your request. Unlike slash commands (which require explicit `/command` invocation), Claude intelligently recognizes when a skill is relevant.

## How Skills Work

1. **Discovery** - Claude loads only skill names/descriptions at startup (minimal tokens)
2. **Activation** - When your request matches a skill's description, Claude asks permission
3. **Execution** - Claude follows the skill's instructions, loading referenced files as needed

## Creating Custom Skills

Skills live in `.claude/skills/` directories with a `SKILL.md` file:

```
~/.claude/skills/my-skill/
└── SKILL.md
```

### Basic Example

```yaml
---
name: explaining-code
description: Explains code with diagrams and analogies. Use when asking "how does this work?"
allowed-tools: Read, Grep
---

When explaining code:
1. Start with an analogy
2. Draw ASCII diagrams
3. Walk through step-by-step
```

### Skill Locations

| Location | Path                | Scope             |
| -------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| Personal | `~/.claude/skills/` | You, all projects |
| Project  | `.claude/skills/`   | Team members      |

## Context Efficiency (Progressive Disclosure)

Skills use a **three-tier progressive disclosure** system to optimize context usage:

| Level | What's Loaded                           | When                                     |
| ----- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Skill name + description only           | At startup (~50-100 tokens per skill)    |
| 2     | Full `SKILL.md` content                 | When Claude determines skill is relevant |
| 3+    | Supporting files (`reference.md`, etc.) | On-demand during execution               |

Key insight from Anthropic:

> "Agents with a filesystem and code execution tools don't need to read the entirety of a skill into their context window when working on a particular task. This means that the amount of context that can be bundled into a skill is effectively unbounded."

### Multi-file Structure

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md           # Always loaded when activated (~500 lines max)
├── reference.md       # Loaded ONLY when Claude needs it
├── examples.md        # Loaded ONLY when referenced
└── scripts/
    └── helper.py      # Executed, never loaded into context
```

In `SKILL.md`, reference supporting files:

```markdown
For API details, see [reference.md](reference.md)
```

Claude reads `reference.md` **only when the task requires it**.

## Skills vs Slash Commands

| Feature    | Skills                             | Slash Commands                 |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Invocation | Automatic (Claude decides)         | Explicit (`/command`)          |
| Structure  | Directory + SKILL.md               | Single .md file                |
| Best for   | Complex, auto-discovered workflows | Quick, frequently-used prompts |

## Configuration Options

| Option          | Purpose                                                        |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`          | Required. Lowercase with hyphens (max 64 chars)                |
| `description`   | Required. Tells Claude when to use this skill (max 1024 chars) |
| `allowed-tools` | Restrict available tools (e.g., `Read, Grep, Bash(git:*)`)     |
| `model`         | Specify Claude model to use                                    |

## Benefits

1. **Automatic discovery** - No need to remember commands
2. **Team standardization** - Commit to repo for shared workflows
3. **Complex workflows** - Include scripts, reference files, validation
4. **Context efficiency** - Progressive disclosure keeps context small
5. **Consistency** - Ensures practices applied uniformly
